# MySQL Comprehensive Assessment
# librarary managment system

## Project Overview

This repository contains a MySQL script designed for a comprehensive assessment task. The script creates a `library` database and defines several related tables, including `Branch`, `Employee`, and `Books`. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a relational database structure using MySQL.

## Database Schema

### Database: `library`

The database contains the following tables:

- **Branch**
  - `Branch_no`: INT, Primary Key
  - `Manager_Id`: INT
  - `Branch_address`: VARCHAR(255)
  - `Contact_no`: VARCHAR(15)

- **Employee**
  - `Emp_Id`: INT, Primary Key
  - `Emp_name`: VARCHAR(100)
  - `Position`: VARCHAR(100)
  - `Salary`: DECIMAL(10, 2)
  - `Branch_no`: INT, Foreign Key references `Branch(Branch_no)`

- **Books**
  - `ISBN`: VARCHAR(20), Primary Key
  - `Book_title`: VARCHAR(255)
  - `Category`: VARCHAR(100)
  - `Author`: VARCHAR(100)
  - `Publisher`: VARCHAR(100)
  - `Publication_year`: YEAR
  - `Copies_available`: INT

### Relationships

- The `Employee` table is linked to the `Branch` table through the `Branch_no` foreign key, indicating which branch each employee works at.
